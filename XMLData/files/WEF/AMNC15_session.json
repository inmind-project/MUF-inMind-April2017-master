Causes for this vary: middle-level staff providing data to top management often lack understanding of what the executives really need; business and IT people don't connect; data is not sufficiently standardized;barriers to data flow exist between different departments, etc. One way to emphasize the importance of data is to reset Key Performance Indicators (KIPI), to promote a culture of leveraging data for decision-making.

So far, scientists have found organic molecules in samples of the comet that have never been seen outside of Earth. Studying our solar system and comets in particular allows researchers to look back at the beginning of the solar system’s formation and Earth as it cooled about 3.5 billion years ago. As comets carry the necessary ingredients for the formation of life, the collision of a comet into planets like ours could create the necessary conditions for the genesis of life.",

Within a decade, most nearby stars will have been assessed for habitable planets with the help of two missions: TESS by NASA and Plato by ESA. By analysing the light as it passes through the atmosphere of a planet, scientists can deduce its chemical composition and gauge how likely the planet is to contain the necessary ingredients to support life. More-powerful telescopes being deployed in the coming years will provide an even closer look at the formation of the universe and help answer long-held questions.",

        "description": "The most successful consumer companies in China make a point of understanding its large, complicated market. For example, the white goods firm Haier segments its products by demographics and region. In the north of China, people tend to eat more meat and freeze it, so Haier sells refrigerators with a large freezer section; in the south, the diets consist of more vegetables so they market refrigerators with larger refrigerated sections. In urban areas, refrigerators are smaller for apartment living; and in rural areas where a refrigerator is a status symbol, they are as large as possible.",

For example, eBay entered China attempting to use the same model that had been successful in the US. Users would pay for goods and then wait to receive them. This model failed as it did not take into account the cultural specifics of China, namely a lack of trust between buyers and sellers. Taobao solved this problem by instituting a third-party payment system, releasing the money only when the product was received. These kinds of cultural specifics are a common barrier to entry for foreign e-commerce companies.",

Scientists used a massive, randomized control sample in researching the syndrome; meanwhile in China, every grandmother shared the knowledge that a baby must sleep on its back, and has done so for generations. In New Zealand, after the research pinpointed the cause, deaths from this syndrome fell by 80%.",
