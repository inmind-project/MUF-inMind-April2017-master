He has received several awards, including Premio Sapio Junior per la Ricerca Italiana, the Medal \"Le Scienze in Fisica\" with the \"Medal of the Presidency of the Republic », Award Sapienza Ricerca. He is the author of more than 100 publications in international journals (among which 12 pubblications on Nature journals) and about 100 invited presentations at national and international conferences. Since 2009, Fabio Sciarrino has obtained fundings for the University of Roma “La Sapienza” as principal investigator for a total amount of more than 3.200.000 euros (approx. 2.800.000 from Europe and 400.000 from Italy). In 2010 he won the project HYTEQ (Hybrid Technologies for Quantum Information Processing) funded by FIRB - Future in Research for young Italian researchers. In 2012 he was awarded an ERC grant Starting Grant-Consolidator 3D-QUEST (www.3dquest.eu). He is the european coordinator of the project Marie Curie Initial Training Networks (ITN): PICQUE (Photonic Integrated Compound Quantum Encoding) started September 2013 (www.picque.eu). He is the european coordinator of the project FET(Future and Emerging Technologies): QUCHIP (Quantum Simulation on a Photonic Chip) starting in March 2015. He has the lecture in Quantum Information and Computation at the University \"La Sapienza\". His research has been devoted mainly to the experimental realization of quantum information protocols by exploiting the methods of quantum optics. To achieve his results has required the development of innovative experimental techniques based on non-linear optics, ultra-fast lasers and detection methods, as well as of new theoretical insights. The results of his investigations have advanced the experimental techniques of quantum optics and contributed to understanding some conceptual aspects of the foundations of quantum mechanics and quantum information theory. His current research activity is focused on integrated quantum photonics, specifically on the implementation of boson sampling and quantum simulation.",

Xianmin Jin is thus developing quantum integrated photonics, an elegant way to find a solution to the limitation of computational power of human beings.

As of today we have fulfilled organic food home delivery services to over 500,000 families in 6 metropolitan cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Hangzhou, and Tianjin. In 2012, we set up Organic and Beyond Fund, to promote exchanges and cooperation between China and the other countries. Now, we have done a lot of work on sustainable consumption with WWF and UNEP.\n\nIn organic practice, we found that the enterprises lack of appropriate guidance, the organic sector has a bottle-neck, and organizational leadership needs to be upgraded in China. Fortunately, I have worked for OABC for nearly seven years. I’m familiar with the relevant standards of organic agriculture and processing technology, and I understand the current situation of China's organic industry development better.
