He is an experienced dealmaker and flexible, goal-driven leader with a track record of managing successful teams in the context of high uncertainty, including turnarounds, highly distressed business/financial situations and pre-/post-merger environments.  \n\nCurrently, Sanjay serves as an advisor to family offices, early stage ventures, and funds in formation. In 2012, Sanjay co-founded Tau Investment Management, a Private Equity Fund focused on disrupting supply-chains globally and served as the Firm’s first Managing Partner. Earlier in 2012, Sanjay was responsible for forming a bidding coalition between two members of Fortune 50 for the Los Angeles Dodgers in one of the most publicized auctions in history. In recent months, Sanjay has been excited to see one of his longstanding entrepreneurial projects in disruptive health care find sponsorship from the legendary Silicon Valley investor and philanthropist, Vinod Khosla. \n\nPreviously, Sanjay served as an Advisor to a member of the top 50 of the Forbes 400 Richest Americans with a net worth in excess of 14 BN USD. His work spanned the management of distressed portfolio companies, strategic acquisitions, strategy development, and business development. Late in 2010, Sanjay participated in the sale of a portfolio company in a public transaction valued at $2.9 Bn USD. \n\nPrior to joining Abraxis, he served as Chief of Staff and Director of Social Enterprise at Intel Corporation, reporting to then General Counsel, Bruce Sewell.  He has also served as the Chief Financial Officer and Director of Strategy for Dossia, a social-enterprise sponsored by Intel, Wal-Mart, Pitney-Bowes, AT&T, Sanofi-Aventis, Cardinal Health, Vanguard Health, Abraxis, Applied Materials, and BP America.  At Dossia, Sanjay worked with the former Chairman and CEO of Intel, Dr. Craig Barrett, as well as the former Chairman and CEO of Pitney Bowes, Michael Critelli. \n\nEarlier in his career, Sanjay was Managing Director and Founder of REALSTRATEGY, a consulting firm based in the US and focused on mid-market financial services firms, social entrepreneurs and health care entities.  He was also a Partner at Geo Health Partners, a Multi-Family Office investment partnership focused on health care investments domestically and internationally. \n\nSanjay was educated at the University of Oxford, Merton College, where he completed his graduated studies in finance and strategy. He studied Philosophy and Bioethics at Georgetown University and also studied Leadership at the Harvard Kennedy School, and has received multiple post-graduate certificates from Harvard Business School. In 2010, Sanjay was honored by the World Economic Forum (Davos) as a Young Global Leader, among less than 200 selected annually for the honor from around the globe.",
