5) Recommend session
	That sounds fun.
	Actually ... i heard about  session earlier that i think you may be interested in .. but before i tell you about it, let me look at your schedule first to check your availability. Hope that is okay ?
	So ... I heard about this cool session called [title] ... and, it doesn't clash with your schedule, either. interested ? should i tell you more about it ?
	So ... do you know about the [title] session? It's tomorrow morning… you're free at that time, and it sounds right up your ally.
	Oh, is that like the stuff going on in the [title] session later today? Do you know about that one?
	Yeah, I think I'd also just want to go to the really popular sessions. There's one later everyone keeps talking about… do you know about the [title] session?	
	Yeeeahh…. Okay, I wasn't too sure about that one either.
	okay, RUDE! I am providing a service!

	Oh, woah, I didn't hear that. Interesting. Hmmmm……	
	Hmm ... Let me see if I can remember … I think they said it is at 2:30 PM tomorrow, and its participants include XXX, YYY. I pulled up its description for you on the screen as well.
	Yeah! Here, I looked it up earlier when I heard about it, let me find you the description… okay, ready? [description]
	You wanna go? I can add it to your calendar if you want!
	Cool! All added. I like feeling useful.
