# this line is a comment because it starts with a hash sign
# comment lines are ignored. empty lines are also ignored.

# the above line was empty (hence ignored).

# for the moment, the following slot types are implemented:
# - #title (the movie to be recommended)
# - #reason (the first entity in the explanations list -- can be genre or director or actor so be careful with the wording)
# - #actor/director/genre: the first liked value of each of these in the corresponding list of liked entities
# - #dislikedActor/dislikedDirector/dislikedGenre: the first disliked value of each of these in the corresponding list of disliked entities

# for the entity lists, should I implement randomization? Should we try to add the decay function for old entities somewhere and weigh by that?
# Please let me know if you want more, I'm very open to discussing further slots (and their grounding).
